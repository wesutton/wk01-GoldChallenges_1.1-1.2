/* 
    - write an object literal that stores information about your favorite movie. nameOfMovie, runTime, characters, and genre should be keys directly inside the object.
        - characters will be an array that should store no more than 2 character objects, each of which stores name, age, and items.
        - items itself will also be an array that should store no more than 2 item objects. These items objects can have key-value pairs of whatever you would like (ex. {itemOne: 'Bow and Arrow'}).

    - use console.log statements to show that you can print out the nameOfMovie, runTime, the characters, the name of a character, and one of the items a character has. Your console should look similar to the screenshot below.
